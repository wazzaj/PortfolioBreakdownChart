PortfolioBreakdown
=========================
##Overview
This Rally app will display a pie chart showing a breakdown of the count of children for each portfolio item. For example, it will show the count of child Features for an Initiative. This is handy in giving a high level view of the focus on each portfolio item with comparison to each other.
